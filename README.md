•   Import the data file into a data frame. 

•   Identify any duplicate rows in the data set.

•   Group all IDs by state, then run descriptive statistics (mean, median, min, & max) for all numeric variables by state and store this result as a new data frame. (Code should be modified from “D598 Task 2 Original Code” in the supporting documents section)

•   Filter the data frame to identify all businesses with debt-to-equity ratios that are negative.

•   Create a new data frame that provides the debt-to-income ratio for every business in the data set. Debt-to-income ratio is defined as long-term debt divided by revenue.

•   Concatenate the debt-to-income ratio data frame you created with the original data frame.
